# Atelier's-jams

We all love to challange ourselves, don't we? Well, we are here to help you. 
If you're here, I suppose you've already read our discord announcement and you're here to know more about it. But even if you have not read the announcement, we'll give 
you a little glimpse of what this is about

# About
We decided to host little events, events like small jams. But not just about games, but also about programming and art (We are sorry that we can't host music jams yet).
The idea for the jam/s is simple, we give you a task, you have to complete it in the specified amount of time. If everything goes alright and you guys like it, we'll try to host
the jams every weekend. As we mentioned earlier, we'd host different types of jams, so, if one week, we host a programming jam, it is possible the next week we'll host an art jam.

Now the curriculum is simple, we'll start off with simple tasks in everything, like in the first week, we'd give a task to create a calculator in 2 days, and then slowly slowly, 
we'd increase the difficulty. It goes for all types of jams.

The reason we're doing it this way is because, many of us are new to programming/game-dev/art here, so we thought it'd would help us if we gave them little tasks ourselves so that
everyone could learn something new every week.

# Submission
To submit your project, lets say its a programming project, you have to make a repository, and upload your program's files there, then, send the link to your repo/project to our
discord #github-submissions channel. 
The same thing you could do for our "game jams".
But now for art, for art you could just send the image or video in the #art-submission channel.

# Rating
Now how would we rate? 
For rating, we will use strawpoll.com. We will put all the participants name on the list.
And you will have to vote the people, whose code/game/art you like the most! You can vote anyone you want, even yourself! Although we would not recommend it since everyone
would be voting for themselves and it would be unfair. The best part is, you could vote for multiple people, although we do recommend not voting more than two people since it 
could impact the results. 
And to review the submissions, you could rate them in their respective channels, like for art submissions, review them in #art-submissions.

# Winner
The person with the most votes will win. And they'll get points, yes points. Points are basically for keeping track of their progress when they finish the jams. The person who has
the most points by the end of the month, will win the month winner role and it will be on that person's discord for one month until the next winner is announced.

But before the month winner, we'll have to set a system for the points.
The most voted person in a jam, will get 10 points
The second most voted person will get 8 points
The third most voted person will get 5 points

And then the person with the most votes by the end of the month, will get the shiny month-winner role on our discord server

# Changes
If everything goes fine, and we get more people to participate than we can handle, we will have to make some changes in the jams. You will be informed of the changes.
